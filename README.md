Graph.cpp works by take an Project array, filling it with the nodes, and then using the indices for the 
rest of the program. A method which proved to be very inefficient, using a hashing algorithm would'v
solved 90% of the problems I had with this program, and would've limited the amount of loops I
had to use to make sure the indices were the correct corresponding indices to the Projects array.

It works by first typing the fileread command which creates the graph, and all the arrays needed to
use the shortest paths algorithm.
